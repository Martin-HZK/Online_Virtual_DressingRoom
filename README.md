# Online Virtual Dressing Room

Virtual Dressing Room is a web application, aiming at enabling customers to try-on clothes before buying them online. <br><br>The traditional shopping experience often involves visiting physical stores and trying on multiple clothing items to find the right fit and style. However, this process can be timeâ€‘consuming, inconvenient, and limited by factors such as store availability and fitting room spaces. The concept of a virtual dressing room software stems from the desire to provide users with a convenient and immersive way to try on different outfits without physically wearing them. This technology has gained popularity.
